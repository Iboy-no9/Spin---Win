# **App Name**: SpinWin

## Core Features:

- Wheel Creation: Create a spin wheel divided into segments with the specified prize possibilities and their corresponding probabilities.
- Spin Animation: Implement a spinning animation that simulates the wheel spinning and gradually slowing down before landing on a prize segment.
- Prize Determination: Randomly determine the winning prize based on the predefined probabilities of each prize, ensuring that 'better luck next time' has a 30% chance, 'sweets' has 25%, '100 rupees' has 5%, '50 rupees' has 10%, '20 rupees' has 10%, and '10 rupees' has 20% chance.
- Prize Display: Display the winning prize to the user after the wheel stops spinning, making it clear what they have won.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Saturated blue (#29ABE2) to evoke a sense of excitement and playfulness.
- Background color: Light blue (#E5F5F9), a very desaturated shade of the primary, for a calming backdrop that makes the vibrant wheel stand out.
- Accent color: Analogous green (#7ED321), is significantly different from the primary in both brightness and saturation to create good contrast. Use this color for highlighting the active segment and celebratory messages.
- Bold, clear fonts for readability, especially for prize labels on the wheel.
- Use simple, recognizable icons to represent prizes where appropriate (e.g., candy icon for 'sweets').
- Ensure the spin wheel is prominently displayed, with clear and intuitive controls for spinning.
- Smooth and engaging animation for the wheel spinning and prize reveal to enhance user experience.
